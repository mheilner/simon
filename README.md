Simon Assignment
This assignment was cool because it started to teach referencing other pages to a single website. Using formatting this really made the website a more cohesive mix


Simon Css 21 Feb 2022
The thing that I learned most about this assignment was the ability to use css and that simplified much of the website code. I think it is cool that there are so many frameworks to use. Bootstrap really makes the process of developing much quicker.

Simon JS
-Integrating the document control from JS to html is very interesting. 
-Need to have a source to the JS document to be able to reference the code in HTML
-No major effects on the CSS. Really JS mostly interacts in this project with HTML
