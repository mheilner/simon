Simon Assignment
This assignment was cool because it started to teach referencing other pages to a single website. Using formatting this really made the website a more cohesive mix

The thing that I learned most about this assignment was the ability to use css and that simplified much of the website code. I think it is cool that there are so many frameworks to use. Bootstrap really makes the process of developing much quicker.
